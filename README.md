Detecting AI-Generated Facial Images Using Transfer Learning with ResNet50
Developed a customized AI model using transfer learning with ResNet50 to combat the growing concern of sophisticated fraud involving AI-generated faces, achieving 97.40% accuracy on test data.
Trained on a dataset of 120,000 images from the CIFAKE collection on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images?resource=download, ensuring comprehensive performance evaluation against fraudulent activities.
Demonstrated proven performance across diverse datasets, confirming the modelâ€™s effectiveness in identifying and mitigating risks associated with AI-generated identities.
Addressed key issues such as the creation of convincing fake profiles, identity theft through synthetic faces, manipulation of user trust, and financial scams using artificial identities.
